The program is built using python 3.10. 

To run it, run main. 
A pop up will appear you can create an account and then login in with that one or you could just press login. (because a login with blank creditentials is hard coded) 
From there you can create a calender, delete one or create one. you can also open the settings to change the timezone. (view public calenders is not implemented) 
When you create a calender make sure when you try to open it you click on the calender in the list of calenders and click open. 
From there, create, update, and delete events. then you can visulize it. (Set public and share calender are not implemented)
If you got this far the events should be self explantory. 

Thanks!

Requirements adhered to: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10. (also 6)
